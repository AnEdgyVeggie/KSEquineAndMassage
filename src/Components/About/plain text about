I graduated from the Dâ€™arcy Lane Equine Massage Program at Trios College. I am a registered equine massage therapist (REMT) through the International Federation of Equine Massage Therapists (IFREMT). I worked at a small animal clinic as an Registered Vet Technicion (RVT) for 7 years prior to deciding to change careers and begin my massage business. I have two horses (a quarter horse and an appendix), and have competed in various western riding disciplines since I was very young. I also have a few crazy Jack Russell terriers. I have a love for animals and it is very important to me to put their needs first!

I offer equine and canine massage, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), red light therapy, and I am taking classes for kinesiology taping for dogs and horses. I am also a registered veterinary technician (RVT) through the Ontario Association of Veterinary Technicians (OAVT).  If you have a concern with your horse or your dog, or would just like to spoil them, please feel free to contact me on this business page, through private messenger or text or call 519-330-7412.
