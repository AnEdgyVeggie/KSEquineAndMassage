				<p className='information' >I graduated from the Dâ€™arcy Lane Equine Massage 
				Program at Trios College. I am a registered equine 
				massage therapist (REMT) through the International 
				Federation of Equine Massage Therapists (IFREMT). 
				I worked at a small animal clinic as an Registered 
				Vet Technicion (RVT) for 7 years prior to deciding 
				to change careers and begin my massage business. I 
				have two horses (a quarter horse and an appendix), 
				and have competed in various western riding 
				disciplines since I was very young. I also have a 
				few crazy Jack Russell terriers. I have a love for 
				animals and it is very important to me to put their needs first!</p>
